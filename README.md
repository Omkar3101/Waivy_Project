# Waivy_Project

A simple, responsive music player web app inspired by Spotify, built using only frontend technologies to browse and preview a list of songs.

## Features

- Waivy is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The app lets you explore a modern, clean music player interface.
- It is inspired by the design and layout of the Spotify music player.
- At present, no songs can be played as no external API is integrated yet.
- You can search through the list of available songs within the app.
- Fully responsive design—works smoothly on all devices.

## Notes

- This project is a purely client-side (frontend-only) application.
- No backend or third-party audio APIs are used right now.
